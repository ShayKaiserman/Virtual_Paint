# Virtual_Paint
# draw on computer screen in every color, using webcam and OpenCV color detection

# STEP 1 - capture video from computer camera.
# STEP 2 - choose a color to draw with (user clicking on the screen)
# STEP 3 - detect the color name.
comparing over 1000 colors database and RGB values.
plot the name of the chosen color.
# STEP 4 - imply a mask
imply a mask to the imge with the same color values, to detect our marker/pen.
# STEP 5 - detect the contours of the marker and define his "paint point".
# STEP 6 - draw on the screen
 drawing on differnent window with the same color that have been chosen.
 we can choose different objects and paint with different colors on the same screen.
 comment: we imply in every given time one mask, and therfore we can only paint with one color at a time.
